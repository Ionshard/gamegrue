Well, I have been absent for quite some time. I can explain though the explanation isn't that good. The fact is I started feeling real resistance when coming back. I just couldn't bring myself to release videos. That's the interesting thing though, it wasn't recording videos I didn't want to do. I actually have had The Long Dark episodes 3, 4 and 5 recorded since December and they've been edited and uploaded to YouTube waiting to be scheduled for more than a week.

This allowed me really to see the pain point. I was dragging my feet around the scheduling process and most explicitly actually writing the companion blog post that accompanies the videos. So I am stopping.

I will be moving to focus on YouTube releases (like everyone else) and stop trying to be so different. I have redone the website such that the homepage with all the videos is now automatic and I will use the website only as a blog on the side.

Nothing will really change if you actually care. Social media posts will now come from YouTube instead of GameGrue.com and email based subscriptions (which I have 0 of) will no longer receive notifications of new videos.

So with that, I will be attempting to commit to a new schedule. I started trying to unofficially upload a video every day but this was a little much. Going forward I will officially be releasing a video at 6 pm EST every Tuesday through Friday. Basically, I am giving myself Monday off because this was always the hardest to get around to doing.

If you're reading this, thanks for caring about my little side project. With this introspection also came some other desires. So I may be pushing the channel a little more in the future, though I may talk about that in an episode.

Thanks for watching
Game Grue

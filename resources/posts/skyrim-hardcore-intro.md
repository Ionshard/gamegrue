## The Return

So I had some vacation from my full-time job but the trip I booked it for was canceled, so I had some free time on my hands. One of the things I wanted to do was make some more Game Grue videos. So I researched some games and picked one, it wasn't Skyrim.

## The Distraction

Then the Skyrim Special Edition came out and I was really excited for mods on the PS4 and I bought it. Now I had read that the PS4 wasn't going to support mods and then later heard that the PS4 would, in fact, have mods ... and that's all I read. I should have looked further into it. The "mod support" that Sony delivered can barely be considered that at all. It's absolutely abysmal.

Now I know it's my fault, I should have done more research before I bought the game but I didn't and I was mad. So I decided who cares, I am going to figure out the mods on the old Skyrim for PC which I already owned.

My goal was simple. I wanted the [Frostfall mod][frostfall] to add more realism to the game. Figuring out how to setup and install the mod was actually quite simple. I used the Nexus Mod Manager to handle the install but the fancy direct install links were down due to the popularity of Skyrim SE that I just had to download all the files manually. Real easy and I should have done this sooner.

However, the story doesn't end that quick. I soon found that I was going down a deep rabbit hole. Every mod I installed led me to more mods that seemed interesting or worked well together and before I knew it I had spent about 4 hours installing mods and didn't even play the game. I had at this point probably around 60 mods.

## The Reward

So I started a game, and really enjoyed it. An important aspect was the [Random Alternate Start mod][ras] which made the game feel totally different. I had played vanilla Skyrim a lot and it always started with the tutorial through Helgen and then into Riverwood and eventual along to Whiterun via a well-designed railroad that the game developers put in to get new players up and going. However, I am not a new player and going through that all the time puts you in the "Well we're playing the same Skyrim again" mood. With the Random Alternate Start mod, this all changed immediately. I was placed randomly on the outskirts of Solitude and told about "rumors" of dragons around Helgen that I could investigate if I wanted to pick up the main quest, but otherwise, I was on my own. I had no expected direction. No single quest to lead me along a story ... it was just me and the world of Tamriel. 

I ended up wandering into Solitude to get some shelter from the cold and I needed a place to sleep. So I found myself at the Winking Skeever. I had nothing to do and a little coin in my purse and I needed a bed. It was 10 septims for the night and I spent another 41 septims getting a waterskin so I could quench my thirst throughout the rest of the game. Then while talking to Corpulus Vinius he told me that the Bards College was looking for new applicants. So I wake up the next morning and head out to the local Bards College to see if I have what it takes. The head of the college, Viarmo, sends me off on a quest to fetch a long lost verse to recite to the Jarl of Solitude so that she will reinstate The Burning of King Olaf, a festival the Bards College puts on every year.

Of course, off I go into the wilderness which was much more frightening now that I had to make sure I stayed warm, hydrated and fed. I end up in the crypts fighting Draugr and getting the lost verse back. This felt like typical Skyrim I knew but in a comfortable sort of way. Emerging from the depths having defeated the undead corpse of King Olaf One-Eye himself. I return with the verse and Viarmo finds parts missing which I persuade him to fill in the blanks. Off we go to the Jarl and she loves the poem and reinstates the festival immediately. During the festival, I am coronated as the newest member of the Bards College. I'm really excited. This had taken a couple of days, I had spent a couple of nights in the Winking Skeever and the boarding costs were really starting to hurt my coin purse. I had plundered some while retrieving the verse but I would finally have my own bed. I had a community. Well turns out the Bards College doesn't give you a bed when you join (unlike the other guilds and factions you can join) and I decided that just wouldn't do. So back to the internet I went and found a nice mod that allows you to become an actual Bard as well as adds a bed to the college. So now I did have my own bed and a new set of skills to learn. I was well on my way to becoming a world-renowned thespian.

This took place over a couple of hours of playing the game. It may not sound that interesting but what's really important to note is that I did not start the game with the intent to become a bard. The game led me there and it just happened. It was completely emergent gameplay based on the randomness of the starting location and the size of my wallet. I had done the Bards College quests before while playing through the game, but it never felt as monumental as this time. It was just another side quest to get through on my way to "beating the game." However this time it wasn't just another side quest, it was the main quest. It mattered more. It was amazing.

## The Result

I found myself wanting to share this experience. This was Skyrim like I had never before played it. It brought my love of the Elder Scrolls universe and placed it into my favorite genre of survival games. It felt like a whole new game. That's when I gave up on the other game I was going to play and decided I wanted to make a Skyrim Let's Play.

Now interestingly this decision was not made lightly. See Game Grue is actually my 3rd attempt at making Let's Play videos. I had previously tried to make Minecraft videos and they turned out horrible and I never uploaded them. Then a long time later, I decided I would try to make Skyrim Let's Plays. At that time I was trying to make 10-minute videos and I just could not make Skyrim interesting to watch. So eventually those were scrapped too. So now that I have decided to bring Skyrim back I really didn't want to end up in the same situation. Interestingly the Minecraft videos I tried to make were by trying to play in a Hardcore Survival mode. If you die, you're dead. Then on this channel, my favorite series was The Long Dark which was another type of Hardcore Survival game. With my currently installed mods, I had Skyrim at least playing kind of like a Survival game. So I went about adding more mods to bring it into the Hardcore Survival game.

So I am currently at 93 mods and I just finished the first episode. I sure hope this works out! So far I am having a lot of fun planning this game and I think it will be fun to see it play out. I love hardcore because it makes everything so much more suspenseful and I was able to put a nice little twist on it for Skyrim.

So check out the Skyrim Hardcore Survival Let's Play and let me know how it goes. Also, I will release another post going over the mods that I am using.

Hello and welcome to the Game Grue blog, this is the first post for this site and is here to provide some background information about me as well as an outline and a little direction on what I want to achieve with this site.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>

To start off I have been a fan of video games for a long time. There is an old family video of me playing some sort of platform game on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurboGrafx-16">TurboGrafx-16 Entertainment SuperSystem</a> where I would just repeatedly jump off the ledges on purpose because it caused my younger brother to just crack up laughing. This is even before my autobiographical memory starts so if I use the old cliché saying of I’ve been playing video games since before I can remember, I’m being quite literal.

My later years involved playing video games at my cousin’s house who had a <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> and I was always so excited to go visit to get a chance to play games on it. This was my only access to video games for several years until my cousin eventually hands down his <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> and his games, including his copy of the original Final Fantasy to my family. This is where my gaming interest really took shape, I didn’t quite understand the Final Fantasy game but I was determined to beat it after watching my cousin play it. There were so many times I got stuck and had to wait until we visited my cousin so I could ask him what to do next, those were the days before the internet could solve all my problems. Other games in my cousin’s library that I can remember playing are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_Silius">Journey to Silius</a> and The Legend of Zelda. I remember being really bad at Journey to Silius and barely being able to beat the first boss but that didn’t stop me from playing it a lot. I also never beat The Legend of Zelda until many years later when playing it on an emulator. However the gaming bug stuck, but up until now I have not bought a single game for myself, just hand me downs but my love of Final Fantasy will soon change that.

Enter December of 1997 with Christmas coming up and the release of Final Fantasy VII has me determined to beg, beg and beg for a Sony Playstation. Well the Gaming Gods were watching us that year and my brother and I got the Playstation. We were so happy even though we didn’t get any games for it at first. We just played the provided <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaRappa_the_Rapper">PaRappa the Rapper</a> demo a lot. Eventually I got my copy of Final Fantasy VII as a gift and this was my first video game that was my own. I played Final Fantasy VII so much. I still vividly remember the frustration I felt after getting out of Midgar and having to play through the next cut scenes so many times because I wasn’t aware that I could save anywhere on the world map and I could never make it to a save point in a single play session. After that it becomes a typical gamer’s history, my brother and I eventually playing many styles and consoles worth of games. This early exposure has cause me to become a Final Fantasy fan and have purchased every title game since then since it’s such a base of my childhood.

<h2>What I know?</h2>

I really enjoyed playing video games but I was growing up with Attention Deficit Disorder and I had a bad habit of not beating any games, the fact that most of the games I played were rented didn’t help much. However this left me feeling that I was a bad gamer, I had friends who could seem to play through an entire game but I always seemed to get bored and want to move on to the next thing. What this did though was give me exposure to a large amount of video games and they became an important part of my life. This line of thinking eventually had me wanting to learn how to make video games for myself so off I went to figure that out. First I learned that in order to make video games you had to do this thing called “programming” so I got the book “Learn C++ in 21 Days” and went to work. I was in grade 9 at the time or a freshman in high school as other parts of the world may put it and I remember using this new-found programming knowledge to solve a lot of my math homework, so you can imagine I was impressed. I really took a liking to programming and I wanted to do more. My home room teacher in school happened to be the teacher who taught the programming courses and at the end of grade 9 he had me signed up for a grade 11 programming class telling me to skip the grade 10 because I would be bored. This programming class was the most fun I have had in school and my final project was an implementation of the Othello board game that even included simple AI. I was really proud of my recursive next move algorithm especially considering we hadn’t been taught recursion yet. This was my first ever video game though unfortunately the source code has been lost to the ages.

Now that I have started to make video games I wanted to do better, I want to make “real” video games, this is what caused me to focus on learning OpenGL. I wanted to make 3D games and this was the start of my downfall. If you have never done 3D game programming from a low-level library than you would know it’s hard, a lot harder than my 15-year-old mind could handle. I wasn’t even aware at the time but I was even lacking some very fundamental algebra knowledge that I wouldn’t officially learn until my first year at University. However I tried to stick it out and this caused me to waste a lot of time trying and failing to learn something that was so far over my head. The reason I wasted this time instead of just learning something I could do was because I had the limiting belief that I wasn’t creative. I hated my English courses, I could never figure out who would want to write and I never took any art courses because I wasn’t able to draw and it was frustrating trying to learn. I was convinced that I was a left brain person and that those right brain activities just weren’t for me. However this meant that whenever I tried to make video games I always invariably ran into the "art wall” where I had do something creative. Eventually I couldn’t “program” the game any further I had to design it, and this is where all my projects went to die. It seems silly now thinking that I could somehow program my way out of this problem if I just knew a lower level detail such as a rendering API. Well lessons learned.

Or did I? Eventually I forced myself to follow through and made a missile defence clone called <a href="http://ionshard.com/meteorshower/">Meteor Shower</a> in Python after continually being disappointed with lack of progress. This is one of my proudest projects to this day, but the art is an example of why I kept hitting walls. This didn’t make me spend the time learning how to do those things, it just reinforced the idea that I couldn’t do it.

Even as I finished high school and went on to attend Carleton University in Ottawa for video game development I was still under those limited beliefs and I thought this was a great program because there were no art classes and no philosophical theory classes. There was just great deterministic left brain classes that will teach me to make awesome video games like I have always wanted. I was still fighting the creativity aspects of making video games, even going so far to resign before even trying during my game development classes and just enlisting myself as a freelance programmer to work on someone else’s ideas. Needless to say nothing good really came from these university classes. Turns out you can’t program your way to a great video game and I just stubbornly refused to see it.

This brings us to this blog. Recently I have been opening myself up and realizing the limitations of my beliefs. I think I can do what I always thought I couldn't I just have to trust that everyone can be creative and even though I may never be an amazing artist or writer I have to learn that those skills are still important and to work on them even though they may not come easily to me. I have a lot of wasted time to make up for but I have built a really strong technical foundation that I hope to use to pull myself by my coat tails through this journey I am embarking on.

<h3>What do I want to know?</h3>

As I showed in my history I have spent all my time really focusing on the technical “hows” when making a video game, never really spending the time to learn the philosophical “whys” to make a video game. So this blog will be my attempt at diving into those “whys” and figuring out what they are and how they work. Since I am coming at this problem from a relatively inexperienced angle I don’t have a direct rubric that I plan to follow but I hope to pick up these analytical skills as I go along. Whether this comes from reviews, let’s plays, or game development tutorials hasn’t been decided yet and I am always open to suggestions on how to better improve. I think one of the first skills I am going to have to learn is how to observe a game while experiencing it. I have played plenty of games but if you asked me to sit down and analyze it I would come up empty-handed. I don’t know how to step back and think critically about what I am doing. This may get worse before it gets better as I learn to be aware of how bad I am at this before I learn how to actually do it. The next skill I may have to work on is dealing with my biases. From my history you may have guessed I prefer RPGs or adventure games and you would be correct, I don’t particularly like competitive games, however I want to have a deeper understanding of games in general not just a sub-genre of games. So I am going to have to expand my horizon and maybe play a sports game or maybe a fighting game or two. Who knows maybe when I sit down and open myself up to the experience I might find that I can actually like those style of games. Fun times ahead.

<h3>What do I want to achieve?</h3>

What makes this blog a blog? Well I don’t really know yet, right now everything I have planned I really could do the old-fashioned way with a college ruled notebook and a pen. Write notes on the games I play and go from there. However this is the future and while I am trying to understand the deeper more creative side of video games which is in turn influencing the deeper more creative side of me I need a way to exercise that muscle. So this is the goal of the blog, to not only build my knowledge but also to learn how to take that knowledge and bundle it up in a way that is enjoyable to be consumed by others. Thus the goal of this blog is to build up a decent knowledge base on the design decisions that go into making a video game, expressly pointing them out so that dense people like me can understand the more nuanced decisions that go into making games, and maybe have a little fun along the way.

<h3>Why do you care?</h3>

Honestly right now, you may not care. This is my first attempt at blogging and I’m not expecting to be an expert out of the gate, so in the beginning this blog might be a little dull and not have material that interests everyone. Right now this blog is an exercise for me and is a way to force myself to get critical and analyze what makes good games good, and what can ruin an otherwise good game so that I can make those decisions consciously going forward. If that concept interests you please <a href="http://gamegrue.com">subscribe</a> and stick around it’s going to get good around here.

<h3>What do “you" want?</h3>

If you have found your way here and you have thoughts on the direction I should take this blog than I have open ears. I obviously can’t do what everyone tells me but right now this blog is fairly open-ended so I wouldn’t mind hearing some opinions on what people would like to see from this blog.

<h2>Introductions</h2>
Well, I accidentally drank a bunch of coffee before going to bed which is bad because I don't drink coffee and I normally sleep fine. Combine the lack of sleep with having just spent the entire weekend playing way too much No Man's Sky has resulted in me just needing to get my thoughts down somewhere so they would be out of my brain and well I just happen to have this blog set up based on video games so what a better place to house it!

So welcome to my thoughts on the recently released game No Man's Sky. TL;DR at End.

Let me start by saying, I wasn't going to get this game. I played Elite Dangerous which is also set in a huge (though not nearly as large) universe and one of the biggest issues I had was with how big it was and needless to say, that was one of the huge selling points of No Man's Sky. However, when the game came out I'm not sure what compelled me to get it but I did and I dove right in.

I haven't quite beaten the game but I did travel to all the Atlas Interfaces (made a misclick at the end so now I can't complete that ending). I have the largest exosuit, the largest multi-tool and the largest ship. They are all pretty much fully upgraded and now it's just a matter of rinse and repeating my way to the center of the galaxy. I've probably spent about 90% of my waking hours this weekend playing the game and that's not counting the couple of full evenings I played before the weekend. Basically, I played a lot, however, I haven't walked away from this game amazed like most other game's that take my time away so thoroughly like other games. (I'm looking at you Minecraft)
<h2>The Good</h2>
First, let's go with the good. What I absolutely loved about No Man's Sky and was pretty much the saving grace was the story. If you've played No Man's Sky you may be asking yourself "What story?" and that's a good point, the story isn't all up in your face like most games. In No Man's Sky you slowly unravel the story of the universe and the history of the aliens that inhabit it. Now I should preface this with the fact that I am completely aware that mystery stories about advanced aliens are basically crack to me. I can't help but want to learn more. I am an absolute addict of the Jove race from EVE Online and the most interesting part about Star Wars was when I wanted to know what the Kessel Run was and ended up spending hours on the wiki reading about The Maw and the ancient races from that universe. So in No Man's Sky when you are plopped into a giant universe filled with 3 advanced alien races who have already explored every single system in this impossibly large "undiscovered" galaxy and you start discovering ancient alien plaques that give away just a little bit of the story every time you find a new one I just had to learn more. Also, you can't forget the Atlas. This big mystery straight from the start of the game had me dying to follow that path. Eventually, I found my way to a system with one of the three species of aliens called the Korvax. Which at the beginning seemed like advanced robots. So that's when I decided I was going to specialize. I have pretty much only played in systems that were attributed to the Korvax and I have voraciously been learning their language so that I can beat all their puzzles and that's when the story started to unfold and I was hooked.

Another thing that really got my blood pumping in No Man's Sky was the progression. I absolutely love taking something frustrating and with time and effort ending up with something effortless. Inventory in No Man's Sky is probably one of the most frustrating things about the early game. You have to prioritize what you can bring because space is so limited that this hurt my hoarder feelings so bad. So much so that I began hunting down every single drop ship I could find to get all the extra space I could manage. My exosuit was the first thing to reach maximum capacity and this was probably much earlier than any of the other thing. I found myself completely ignoring all upgrades because they would detract from my precious inventory space that I could use to collect goodies to then sell for money! Getting my exosuit to the fullest capacity really helped lighten the load. Inventory went from frustrating to manageable (never did get to effortless) but by then I was also working my way up the multi-tool and ship ladder. So the tech progression in No Man's Sky was another thing that really sunk it's hooks into me.
<h2>The Bad</h2>
Now for the not so good parts. Unfortunately, I think the biggest selling feature of the game was the biggest let down to me. I think they say there was something like 18 quintillion (fifteen zeros) different planets in this game. That number is so large that it is completely absurd to even comprehend it. They say if you visited 1 planet every single second then it would take you 5 billion years to visit them all. That's massive! Which is amazing. It brings up such wonderful feelings about obsoleteness. I accidentally renamed something just to my name. (Forgot R2 on PS4 was "done" and it's permanent) However, the odds are no one else will ever see that cool sky worm species named Kasuko ever. The pure size of the galaxy is amazing, awe-inspiring and humbling. It mirrors my feelings about our own Universe. When I look up to the stars on a clear night and try to grasp just how massive our own universe is and how my experience of it is nothing in comparison to what it has to offer. Unfortunately only the real universe actually instills those feelings in reality. No Man's Sky has confused stuff for content and they have successfully delivered a lot of stuff but very little content.

No Man's Sky starts with promises of a huge universe but then delivers in a relatively small package. Sure there are 18 quintillion different planets but are there 18 quintillion interesting planets? Nope! Not even close. How about 1 million? Still nope. Honestly, I think there is 1 interesting planet in No Man's Sky. The one you start on. That's when everything is new and fresh. Sure when you visit another planet it looks different but that is it. All the planets function exactly the same. You have your 9 base resources. A common, uncommon and rare variety of oxides, isotopes and silicates. You got your Iron, Zinc and Titanium oxides. Then there's Carbon, Thamium9 and Plutonium isotopes and finally Heridium, Platinum and Chrysonite silicates. Those are the most important resources and they behave the exact same way on every single planet you visit. For example. The uncommon level of resources are all obtained via a plant. That plant is the exact same on every single planet. Sure there are tons of random procedurally generated foliage and wildlife on all the different planets but they all have the exact same resource giving plants and the rest are just backdrop. Now at least the three plants are all different for each type of uncomment resource. When you get to the rare resources they are all in crystal form just a different color. They are the exact same shape and size as each other, just a different color and they are the same across all planets you encounter. Now for the common tier, I will say that Carbon and Iron are done pretty well. I mentioned the nice random foliage well it comes in two varieties stones and plants, stones give you Iron and Plants give you carbon however those do come in nice varying procedurially generated packages. Heridium on the other hand, introduces the final form of resource representation that you will find. I call it the blob. It's where you take a pile of the resource and stick it in a blob on the map. Heridium is always a black and blue square tower thing that you mine out. Every single planet has the exact same black and blue square piles all around them.

Now of these 9 main resources you can get 8 of them on pretty much every single planet that you visit. Sometimes this is obvious, take for example Plutonium. Plutonium is the fuel you use for you Launch Thrusters. It's what allows your spaceship to take off. This <strong>has</strong> to be on every planet because if you could land and not have the fuel to take off again you would be stranded and that would be game breaking. However the same follows for most of the other resources too in some form or fashion. If the planet is anything other than a barren rock it will have Iron and Carbon on it. If the planet has any plants I pretty much guarantee there will be the three uncommon tier plants on it. Plutonium as mentioned, has to be on every planet to prevent being stranded and I am pretty sure Heridium follows this too because you have the option to trade out your ship for a crashed ship which could have the Pulse Jets damaged which requires Heridium to repair. Thus if you swapped out your ship but didn't have access to Heridium you'd be stranded as well. Finally, almost every planet has little robot drones flying around them called Sentinals and when you kill these you get a hefty amount of Titanium. I would say 95% of all planets I visited thus far had access to 8 of the 9 elements on them. That leaves Chrysonite, what I consider to be one of the genuinely rare and enjoyable base materials. Nothing requires this resource to be on the planet and most planets I visited in fact, didn't have Chrysonite. When I found a planet that had it, I always inevitable stockpiled it and the rush from finding it is definitely what I think the game was trying to evoke but is sadly missing from the rest!

Now I need to address the neutral elements. Aside from the 9 main resources, there are also several neutral elements that are valuable and these do vary between planets but again it's still far too flat. I think every planet I visited had 2 formats of neutral elements. You get one in blob form and another in crystal form (and sometimes they are the same). So you get your blobs of Heridium and some other material, granted the blobs could be in mountain, pillar or floating blob style but they are always haphazardly placed around the planet and also the crystal form is again the exact same crystal that the rare elements are but instead it's green ... always.

If you are starting to see a pattern it's that pretty much everything you are seeking out and interacting with in this game is always the same. I have focused hard on the resources because I feel they are the worst offender, even though the same could be said about the buildings I understand that there is a practical limit to the assets in the game. I would have even felt better if they took all the forms they have and mixed them up for the different tiers per different planets. Sometimes Heridium is in crystal form, or sometimes you have to gather Plutonium from blobs.

Now getting to the "feel" of the planets. This is something that does feel like it genuinely changes. You can get different colors, different atmospheres, different styles of plants and wildlife, some have water while others are just mountains. A lush jungle planet seems totally different from an alien irradiated planet. This was good ... but unfortunately not good enough. While this truly changes from planet to planet unfortunately what you actually have is the palette of the entire planet and this never changes. If you fly along the surface of any planet for 30 seconds you will have essentially seen what the entire rest of the planet looks like. There are no regions on the planets, they are just one contiguous biome that covers the entire surface. Sure there may be islands or tendrils of land shooting out of the ground, but they are always there for the entire planet. If they had some slight palette shifting within the planets I think they would be a whole lot more interesting. Thinking back to Minecraft which is also procedurally generated this is what really kills. When you find that awesome vista where two different biomes meet in a unique and interesting way. Each planet is like playing Minecraft on a map where there is only one biome ... dull. In contrary to this though is the wildlife, boy is it fun to see all the cool and unique animals this game can show you. Like I mentioned earlier when I saw the huge flying eels in the sky the first time I was genuinely transported away and the feelings were amazing. However, you actually do very little interactions with the animals short of trying to scan them all. You can feed and pet them and they will like and follow you around but this is really a minor side gimmick.

Now of course, there are exceptions! Little things that do end up truly making a planet feel unique. Like when I was well into the play session and I thought I had started to see it all when I found a barren frozen planet that had weird little hovering squidlike pods that if you shot gave you an ultra-rare material. Man, that totally blew my mind away. Finding something totally different after all that time. Unfortunately, that's not enough to change the overall feeling of the game and I really do hope there are more of those moments left in the game because I will still be playing because I desperately want to learn more about the galaxy and the underlying story. However when I warp into a system and I have somewhere to be will I feel a pull to explore the planets in that system rather than just firing up the warp drive again? Definitely not. I pretty much only go to planets when I have to refill my resources or I am interested in doing a purposeful grind of the game elements.
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
That's all my thoughts. If you made it this far thanks for caring! I may have been pretty hard on the game but I absolutely do not regret buying it and I will still be playing it going forward. I just feel it didn't live up to the hype and that's coming from someone who never jumped on the prerelease hypetrain which I heard was quite large for this game. Overall I give this game about a 7/10 because it can ensnare me for hours and I have no problem playing it, just at the end of the day I feel like I was playing it for the wrong reasons.

<h2> TL;DR </h2>
Thanks for being honest. The TL;DR of the post is that No Man's Sky has some great parts to it that captivated me for many many hours. However I don't feel like those parts were the main selling point of the game and what they were really pushing felt flat to me.
